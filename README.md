## Bootstrap project react

This is a basis for starting a web app project with React. I wanted to do this to save time to start a new project. I use the latest tools most used by the react community. It is a code base that will rapidly evolve.


Used dependencies:

* webpack
* storybook
* flow
* eslint
* prettier
* styled Component
* jest



### For start project after clone

* install flow-typed on your machine [https://github.com/flowtype/flow-typed](https://github.com/flowtype/flow-typed)

      $ npm install -g flow-typed

* run init script (flow-typed can be long)

      $ npm run init

### For dev

    $ npm run dev

### For build your project

    $ npm run build:prod

The build result is in dist directory.


### Start script

    $ npm start

The project use serve for serving app.
